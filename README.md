Machine Learning Real Estate Project (Relationship between Stock Market & Real Estate Prices)

Description: The purpose of this project was build real-estate pricing model with a dataset which we gathered from Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). And, we combined our dataset with US annual inflation index, return on S&P Composite Index, and US treasury 1 year Bond return in order to predict real-estate prices better. Our goal was build a model to predict transaction prices with an average error of under US Dollars 70,000 [Team Project]
